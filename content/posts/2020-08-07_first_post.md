Questia is a 2D action-adventure game about questing and boss fighting. 
The project is very early into development and will take a while to be playable. 
The game, along with its engine, is being rewritten from the ground up in Rust, but earlier versions of the project are still available from the GitHub organization repository. 
If you are interested in contributing to this project, all skill levels are welcome.
Just send me a message via the contact information on the {{ local_link(text="Contact", path="contact") }} page.
